Jekyll is a static site generator written in ruby. Octopress is a wrapper around Jekyll with nifty features to make it easy to manage your blog. I have used them for my blog [teleported.in](http://teleported.in). Here I have documented the steps to initialize your blog, customize it, and write your first post.

I assume that you have Jekyll and Octopress installed. It is well documented in their respective documentation.
